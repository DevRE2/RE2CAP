# RE2CAP
A new and simple software to estimate soil resistivity with a two-layer model

This tool enables the user to get the two-layer soil resistivity model based on optimization methods: descending gradient and JAYA algorithm.

The main technical highlights are: 

graphical interface, toolbar
wenner sounding data
results reports
